handle castling:
    -for now i have a boolean for the king for kingside and queenside castling.
        -that bool is given to the Move.
    -i need to turn the bool to false when it should be.
    -i need to handle the moving of the rook if the player castles


get possible moves implemented so far:
king (need work with castling)
queen
bishop
rook
knight
pawn (need work with en passant)
